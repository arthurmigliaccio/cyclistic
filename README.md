# Cyclistic Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Cyclistic Data Analysis Project repository! This project focuses on analyzing and gaining insights from the Cyclistic bike-sharing dataset.

## About Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company operating in Chicago City. The company offers bikes on a membership basis, allowing users to rent bikes for short periods. By analyzing the data collected from users, we aim to uncover valuable insights to help Cyclistic optimize its operations and improve user experience.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis performed in this project covers various aspects of Cyclistic's bike-sharing system. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and the development of predictive models or data-driven recommendations.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to dive into the analysis and findings. We have documented our approach and methodology within the notebooks, making it easier for you to understand and reproduce the analysis.
